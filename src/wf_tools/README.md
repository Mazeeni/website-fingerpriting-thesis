This folder contains a modification of the ```wf-tools``` library available here:
https://github.com/jpcsmith/wf-tools.

The following changes have been made:
- add support for downloadable files (as the library throws an error if HTML response is empty)
- add flag to k-fingerprinting classifier to allow user to choose whether or not to use nearest neighbours algorithm on leaves of random forest
